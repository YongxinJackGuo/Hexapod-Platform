# Hexapod-Platform
    A dynamic robotics platform that has potential of sensor fusion based on an inverse kinematics locomotion algorithm. The lastest code was uploaded, which consists of two sets of hexapod gaits: ripple gait and tripod gait. The third gait, wave gait, is currently in my future plan. 
    The top priority right now is to transform this 3-DOF code (this code is based on 3 servos per leg configuration) into 2-DOF code in the mini version of hexapod with 2 servos per leg configuration.
